# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Compatibility patch for Ray >=2.0
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The original PokerRL `MaybeRay` wrapper passed a `redis_max_memory` argument
# when initialising Ray.  This option was removed from newer Ray releases,
# causing `ray.init` to raise `RuntimeError: Unknown keyword argument(s)` when
# running Deep-CFR with modern Ray versions.  Here we monkeyâ€‘patch the
# `init_local` method to drop the obsolete parameter and keep the existing
# behaviour of limiting the object store memory.
#
# This code executes on import so the patched behaviour is applied before the
# framework initialises Ray.
